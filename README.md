# Customer Churn Prediction App 🚀

A full end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts **customer churn risk** using a trained Decision Tree model, deployed live with **Streamlit Cloud**.

🔗 Live App: https://mayankjindal-customer-churn-predictor.streamlit.app/

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn refers to customers who stop using a product or service.  
This app helps estimate **how likely a customer is to churn** based on key features such as:

- Tenure
- Monthly charges
- Total charges
- Contract type
- Tech support availability
- Internet service type

The goal is to assist businesses in identifying high-risk customers and taking proactive retention actions.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details

- **Problem Type:** Binary Classification  
- **Target Variable:** Churn (Yes / No)  
- **Final Model Used:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Reason for selection:** Highest recall among tested models (better at catching churners)

### Models Compared
| Model | Used |
|------|------|
| Logistic Regression | ❌ |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | ❌ |
| Decision Tree | ✅ Final |

---

## 🧪 Model Performance (on test set)

- Accuracy: ~80%  
- Recall (Churn class): ~63%  
- F1-score: ~0.63  

Focus was placed on **recall**, as missing churn customers is costlier than false positives.

## 📓 Training Pipeline

The complete model training and evaluation process is available in:

`ml_pipeline_churn.ipynb`

This notebook includes:
- Data cleaning
- Feature encoding
- Train/test split
- Model comparison
- Final model selection
- Exporting trained artifacts using `joblib`

---

## 📊 Dataset

The model was trained on the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**, located in:

`data/Telco_customer_churn.xlsx`

The dataset contains customer-level information such as:
- Demographics
- Service usage
- Billing details
- Contract types

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.12  
- scikit-learn 1.6.1  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- joblib  
- Streamlit

## 🌐 Deployment

The app is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud** and runs in a controlled environment.

Key challenges solved during deployment:
- Python version mismatch
- Pickle incompatibility
- NumPy / scikit-learn conflicts
- Cloud runtime differences

Final solution uses:
- Python 3.12
- scikit-learn 1.6.1
- numpy 2.0.2

---

## ▶️ Run Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayankjndl/churn-prediction-app
cd churn-prediction-app

pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```
Then open: http://localhost:8501

## 📈 Example Output

The app returns:

- Churn probability (percentage)
- Risk category:
  - Low risk
  - High risk
- Example:
  - Low Churn Risk (16.49%)

---

## 🔐 Model Persistence Note

Models are stored using joblib.
Pickle files must always be loaded using the same library versions they were trained with.
